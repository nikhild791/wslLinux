### We can run docker inside the ubuntu distro of wsl for that we need to install the docker after but there is a plot twist 
```wsl -l``` the default linux distro will only have the docker connection if you want other distros to have the docke r following the command
-> go to dokcer setting inside resource inside wsl  integration
enable the distros you are good to go
now you can run
ubuntu within docker within ubuntu within windows

### To find windows file inside linux
all shits are inside mnt

### to find linux file inside windows file explorer
```explorer.exe .```
now open the desired file with open with code command (visual studio) edit it and the changes are visible inside ubuntu machine
see previously we are opening vs code using ```code .``` command that opens the editor but inside the linux machine which might be slow but this is fast 
### sorry it opens the linux file inside the windows code editor whatever you like you can use it either use explore to open or code .
